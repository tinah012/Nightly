Please note that this code is provided from FlutterFlow. This platform allowed me to create Nightly from a low-code/no-code perspective and it filled in the steps for me, allowing for a much faster app-building process. I have provided the code anyways for your consideration. 

I made minimal edits/contributions to the code if I wasn't sastified with the frontend design. I also called Gemini's API for my explore feed implementation.
